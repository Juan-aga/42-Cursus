## Projects

This repository contains the following 42 course projects:


### Libft 

The Libft project involves implementing various standard C library functions, as well as additional functions that can be useful in C project development.

The library also includes the "get_next_line" project, which provides a function for reading a line from a file descriptor, and the "printf" project, which implements a simplified version of the printf function.

In addition, various other functions have been implemented as part of different projects throughout the course and have been included in this library for convenience.

### fract'ol

This project focuses on creating visually stunning fractals using the MiniLibX graphics library. A fractal is an abstract mathematical object characterized by a pattern that repeats at every scale. In this project, you will generate and explore different types of fractals, including the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set, utilizing various rendering techniques.

### Push_swap

This project focuses on sorting data using a stack and a limited set of instructions, aiming to achieve the most efficient sorting algorithm with the fewest number of actions. The objective is to implement various sorting algorithms and select the optimal solution for sorting given data.

- [Push_swap](https://github.com/Juan-aga/push-swap/)

### Philosophers

This project explores threading and mutexes through the simulation of philosophers sitting at a round table. The program ensures philosophers can eat without starvation and avoids data races.

### Minishell

This a project that involves creating a simple shell in C. The shell displays a prompt, supports history, executes commands based on the PATH variable, handles redirections, pipes, environment variables, and built-in commands. It also handles special characters and signals. The goal is to create a functional shell similar to bash, following the project requirements and limitations.
